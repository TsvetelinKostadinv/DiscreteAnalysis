# disana
A take on implementing **dis**crete **ana**lysis library

## Goals
The aim is to provide an easy to use analysis library in C++, however, still in under debate whether speed or accuracy is more desirable. It is a nice project to exercise skills in calculus and programming, nontheless.

## Get it, build it, extend it
To get the code of the project you can either download it as a zip from Github or check it out via `git`:
```bash
git checkout https://github.com/TsvetelinKostadinv/disana
```
[Premake5](https://premake.github.io/) is used as a management system, you can run
```bash
premake5 vs20XX # where you substitute XX with your desired version
```
[Premake5](https://premake.github.io/) also has support for other **IDE**s and you can check the list [here](https://premake.github.io/docs/Using-Premake). As of now the project is not targeting any single compiler so it should build with any compiler which supports C++17. It can also generate `makefiles` for building under Unix based systems.

You can freely fork the repository and make pull request, however, they will be thoroughly code reviewed and must be compliant with the plans of the repository, which can be freely discussed in any communication channel, most of which are found on the Github profile.
